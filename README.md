## A Control Surface for Automatically Changing Clips' Names Based on the Name of their Parent Track In Ableton Live 11+ WITHOUT PLUGINS ;)

\*\*for Mac or Windows\*\*

### 6 Steps to setup:  
**Note: this assumes you are using the default user library folder. If you have moved this folder externally or otherwise, make a Remote Scripts folder inside of whatever user library folder you have pointed Ableton to, and start from step 2:**
1. Mac users:  
   Go to `/Users/your_username/Music/Ableton/User Library`  
   Windows users:  
   Go to `\Users\your_username\Documents\Ableton\User Library`
2. Create a folder 'Remote Scripts' if it's not already created.
3. Create a folder titled 'AutoClip' inside the 'Remote Scripts' folder.
4. Download **both** .py files, "AutoClip.py" and "\_\_init\_\_.py", and place them in the 'Remote Scripts/AutoClip' folder.
5. Restart or open Ableton Live
6. In Ableton, select 'AutoClip' in the "Link|Tempo|Midi" tab, and make sure the input and output are set to 'None'.

**Note**: You can add the 2 mentioned files from here to their respective folders as shown by my tutorial while Ableton is open or quit, but if Ableton is open, then you *will* have to restart Ableton for the selected control surface to go into effect. The reason being is that Ableton compiles python and loads python code into memory when Ableton starts, but not after it loads up. For you using the software, this means that in order to update this script if and when it is updated, then you will have to restart Ableton to use the updated software.

## Lit af features:
1. In Arrangement View: Rename a Midi track named 'Midi' or an Audio track named 'Audio' and then the names of every clip are **magically** changed to the name of their individual tracks + the number the clip is in order from left to right. Order is always maintained.  
2. In Session View: Rename a Midi or Audio Track and then the clips you drag to these tracks or the clips already existing will be renamed the name of the track + the number of the clip from top to bottom.  
3. The number in a renamed clip's name in Session view is not based on the next adjacent clip but rather the next adjacent clip slot whether or not there is a clip. I thought this made more sense for session view.  
4. Anytime you drop a clip in a track, it will automatically be renamed to match the above rules.  
5. Take Lanes are unaffected by this script.
6. If there is one clip in a track in arrangement view, it won't have a number, it keeps its original name.
7. If you have your default Audio and Midi tracks named 'Audio' and 'Midi', then upon dropping one or more clips into the clip/device area or into a default track, the default track's name now becomes the same as the clip's name without the last number separated by a space. So Clip 3 becomes Clip, Clip 3 4 becomes Clip 3, etc.
8. Lastly, when this control surface is enabled, you won't be able to name clips manually, as their names will always be reset whenever you drag a single clip.

Note: You may notice that undo has additional steps from this script. That is normal. Basically, this script adds various custom actions and so two actions are added to your undo stack whenever you do the following:  
-Drag a clip to the clip/device area  
-Drag a clip to a default track  
-Add a clip to a track  
-Rename a track with clips in it  
-Duplicate a clip  

If I find others I will post them.

## Open Issues:
Beta version only: When rapidly deleting tracks, we get an error as shown in the open issues section. And I mean rapid. But if you just delete at a regular pace it wouldn't be an issue. and this is only an error message that I am so fucking stuck on it's not funny at this point. I really want to fix the issue but it is specific to removing event handlers rapidly. As of now it seems that the issue very well could be specific to naming clips in clip slots as opposed to  any other parameter. I won't give up though.  No functionality is interrupted with the error message.  

## Future Updates:
I was thinking it would be cool to use the name of the track to determine if clips will be renamed or not based on a code word.  
For now, every clip is named at once when loading the control surface, I can understand if this is a bit 'all or a nothing' but I figured you always have the option to deselect the control surface in settings.
